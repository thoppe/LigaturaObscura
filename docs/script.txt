I'm a nerd. Not the microscope or telescope nerd, but the artist kind. I also think fonts are the bomb. What your eyes are seeing isn't some tired javascript. Nope, this magic is a FONT.

Maybe you're confused or frowning? That's OK. Look at the HTML, CSS. Javascript? LOL not in this house.

The secret is "ligatures". Look at how "fi" gets transformed. 

You can do that with ANYTHING. From a skull and crossbones to surfers with lipstick. The original text remains too. Watch me paste, and like a ghost the emoji are gone.
